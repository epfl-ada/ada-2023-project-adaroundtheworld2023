## Abstract 📌

In 2004, American entrepreneur Frans Johansson published a book 
“The Medici Effect: Breakthrough Insights at the Intersection of 
Ideas, Concepts, and Cultures” [[1](https://www.goodreads.com/pt/book/show/20482413)]
, where he argues that the biggest 
innovation happens when disciplines, ideas or domains intersect. 
In other words, by merging ideas from a range of diverse backgrounds, 
one can increase the likelihood of intellectual cross-pollination, 
which might lead to innovation and success.

Our aim is to examine if this holds true in the movie industry. 
We focus on the plots and genres and with the help of the embedding 
models we will generate the network graphs. These will help us to 
verify if the relationship between “being at the intersection” 
and the success are linked in the movie industry.

## Research Questions 🔎

Since we apply two different methods for uncovering the patterns 
(see [Methods](https://github.com/epfl-ada/ada-2023-project-adaroundtheworld2023/tree/update-readme#methods-)), 
the research questions fall into two domains: 
(1) *Research Specific* and (2) *Comparison of Methods*.

**Research Specific**. We will examine the relationship 
between “being at the intersection” and the success of a movie. 
The success is defined as the IMDB rating. Thus, we would like 
to answer the following questions:

- Is there a relationship between “being at the intersection of different genres” and the success of a movie? Do movies with more betweenness centrality have better IMDB ratings than the rest?
- Maybe the dynamic is the opposite and movies that resemble any other are more successful? Therefore, do movies with smaller degree have better IMDB ratings than the rest?

**Comparison of Methods**. We will compare two approaches 
described in Methods. The questions are as follows:

- How different are the network graphs generated by the two different approaches? What are the reasons for this? Is this expected?
- Does the final result of the analysis differ depending on the graph generation strategy? Why is it so and what could be the reason?

## Additional Datasets 📚

[IMDB Movies](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/) -  TBD.

## Methods 🎯

First we will explain the data preprocessing pipeline and then 
focus on the analysis. The analysis relies mainly on the graphs, 
which will be generated using two different approaches.

### Preprocessing

TBD

### Analysis

#### Step 1: Graph Generation

As analysis relies on the network graphs, we first need to generate 
them. For this two different approaches will be used.

**Embedding Models and Similarity**. We are going to use an embedding 
model [[2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03533.pdf)] to turn the 
movie plots into vectors and find the similarity 
between them by using matrix multiplication. We can then specify a 
threshold for the similarity to generate a graph, where more similar 
plots will be clustered.

**NLI-based Text Classification**. As an alternative approach, we will let 
the LLM predict the probability that the plot belongs to any of the 
genres [[3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.00161.pdf)]. Although we already have a set of genres specified for every 
movie, (1) this might depend on the data collection and by using models, 
we can (2) limit the genre space and (3) turn the discrete list of genres 
into probabilities. We will then again set the threshold and generate a 
graph that will be used in the following analysis.

#### Step 2: Metrics

Our aim is to test whether “being at the intersection” is correlated with 
the success of a movie. Being at the intersection can be proxied with 
*betweenness centrality* measure 
[[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378873307000731?via%3Dihub)]. 
Betweenness centrality of a node $v$ is 
the sum of the fraction of all-pairs shortest paths that pass through $v$:

$$ c_B(v) =  \sum_{s,t \in V}^{}  \frac{ \sigma (s, t | v) }{\sigma (s, t)}, $$

where $V$ is the set of nodes, $\sigma (s, t)$ is the number of shortest 
$(s, t)$-paths, and $\sigma (s, t | v)$ is the number of those paths 
passing through some node $V$ other than $s, t$.

Alternatively, we can take a slightly different approach and focus not 
only on the intersections but look at the relationship between “being a 
mix of different plots” and success. We will quantify the “mix of 
different plots” by degree of the node. The degree of a node is the 
number of edges connected to the node.

#### Step 3: Analysis

The analysis will be conducted by first examining the relationship 
visually from the network graphs and then performing correlation analysis.

**Visual Inspection**. We can examine the relationship between “being at 
the intersection” and success visually on the graph by setting the size 
of the node equal to the betweenness measure and color of the node to 
the IMDB rating. We can similarly compare the degree with the IMDB rating.

**Correlation Analysis**. We can perform correlation analysis between the 
IMDB rating and the measures. In addition to marginal correlation, 
we can look at the partial correlation (e.g. decade) by using linear 
regression and dummy variables.
